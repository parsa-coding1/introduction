<li><p class="alaska-airlines">Alaska Airlines is an American airline based in the Seattle metropolitan area of the state of Washington. The company was founded in 1932 as McGee Airways, offering flights from Anchorage, Alaska. Alaska Airlines has flights to more than one hundred destinations in the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Costa Rica, Cuba and Mexico. The airline is a major air carrier and, along with its sister airlines Horizon Air and Virgin America, is part of the Alaska Air Group. The airline has been ranked by J. D. Power and Associates as having the highest customer satisfaction of the traditional airlines for ten consecutive years.</p></li>
            <li><p class="alaska-airlines">The airline operates its largest hub at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport (known as Sea–Tac). It also operates secondary hubs in Los Angeles, Portland, San Francisco, Anchorage, and focus cities at San Diego and San Jose. Although most of its revenue and traffic comes from locations outside of Alaska, the airline plays a major role in air transportation in the state. It operates many flights linking small towns to major transportation hubs and carries more passengers between Alaska and the contiguous United States than any other airline.</p></li>
            <li><p class="alaska-airlines">Alaska Airlines is not a member of any of the three major airline alliances. However, it has codeshare agreements with some members of oneworld, such as American Airlines, British Airways, and LATAM Chile, and with some SkyTeam members, including Air France, KLM, and Korean Air. Delta, which used to cooperate through codeshares with Alaska Airlines until December 19, 2016, is a major competitor to Alaska Air in its Sea-Tac market. The Alaska Air Group has been a part of the Dow Jones Transportation Average since 2011, when it replaced the then-parent company of American Airlines, AMR Corporation, in the index.</p></li>
